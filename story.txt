This is a story about an octopus name succotash, tash for short. Tash lives in
the ocean with his octopus friends, Drew and Noah, and attends school at Coral
 University. One day Tash and his friends were on the way to their computer
 science class when suddenly a human diver with a net dove towards them!

The driver was flying along the surface, but before the octo gang could get
caught in the net, they were quickly scooped up by an oddly friendly yellow 
sponge named bob. Bob was out taking his driving test, when he saw them in 
danger and had to act. Sadly bob ended up failing his exam...again, but the gang
offered to by him a hamburger for saving them.
